# Video to Tutorial Assistant Chatbot

This is an simplified attempt to generate a structured chatbot from a video. Inspired by the [tweet](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1760740503614836917?s=20) from Karpathy and the [response](https://x.com/mlpowered/status/1764718705991442622?s=20) from Ameisen, the goal is to help educators generate a TA to help students review concepts in video. 

I am currently focus on educational videos. The current example used is [this](https://youtu.be/vStJoetOxJg?feature=shared) introductory machine learning video by Andrew Ng.

A simple example TA chatbot is generated on the [Juji](https://juji.io/) platform.

## Future Work

- use LLM to select better image/frame for each tutorial
- include image in RAG
  - image understanding
  - present related image in response
