00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Welcome to machine learning.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,840
What is machine learning?

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,840
You probably use it many times a day without even knowing it.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,360
Anytime you want to find out something like,

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,120
how do I make a sushi roll?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,320
You can do a web search on Google,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,639
Bing, or Baidu to find out.

8
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,760
That works so well because

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,120
the machine learning software has figured out how to rank web pages.

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,520
Or when you upload pictures to Instagram or Snapchat,

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,119
and think to yourself,

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,240
I want to tag my friends so they can see their pictures.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,520
Well, these apps can recognize your friends in your pictures

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,240
and label them as well.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,000
That's also machine learning.

16
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,959
Or if you've just finished watching a Star Wars movie

17
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,400
on the video streaming service,

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,720
and you think, what are the similar movies that I watch?

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, the streaming service will likely use machine learning

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
to recommend something that you might like.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,160
Each time you use voice to text on your phone

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,480
to write a text message.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Hey, Andrew, how's it going?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,560
Or tell your phone,

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,839
hey Siri, play a song by Rihanna.

26
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,480
Or ask your other phone,

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,519
okay Google, show me Indian restaurants near me.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,720
That's also machine learning.

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,160
Each time you receive an email titled,

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,160
congratulations, you've won a million dollars.

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Well, maybe you're rich, congratulations.

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,559
Or more likely your email service

33
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,959
will probably flag it as spam.

34
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,800
That too is an application of machine learning.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,599
Beyond consumer applications that you might use,

36
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,000
AI is also rapidly making its way into big companies

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,879
and into industrial applications.

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,599
For example, I'm deeply concerned about climate change,

39
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,320
and I'm glad to see that machine learning

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,080
is already hoping to optimize wind turbine power generation.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,599
Or in healthcare,

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,919
it's starting to make its way into hospitals

43
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:57,559
to help doctors make accurate diagnoses.

44
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,680
Or recently at Learning AI,

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,959
I've been doing a lot of work

46
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,320
putting computer vision into factories

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,160
to help inspect if something coming off the assembly line

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,399
has any defects.

49
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,360
That's machine learning.

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,880
It's a science of getting computers to learn

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,039
without being explicitly programmed.

52
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,080
In this class, you learn about machine learning

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,119
and get to implement machine learning in code yourself.

54
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,679
Millions of others have taken

55
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,639
the earlier version of this course,

56
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,679
which is a course that led to the founding of Coursera.

57
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,639
And many learners ended up building

58
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,600
exciting machine learning systems

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,360
or even pursuing very successful careers in AI.

60
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,119
I'm excited that you're on this journey with me.

61
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,960
Welcome, and let's get started.
